So the view works,it displays me the files i give as an input
export also works,this is the content of the json(you can also find it in the repo,it s named repository.json):
[".gitignore","homework.docx","homework.pdf","landscape.jpg","pom.xml","report.html","report_template.ftl","repository.json","~$mework.docx"]
report works,you can check the report.html in the repo.
